# Iris - AI Discord Bot

Iris is a powerful and highly configurable Discord bot that connects to the [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) API. It allows server administrators to bring a wide variety of free, high-quality language models into their communities, with fine-grained control over their behavior on a per-channel basis.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Choose from any free model available on OpenRouter.
- **Granular Configuration**:
    - **Server-wide defaults**: Set a default model, command prefix, and admin role for the entire server.
    - **Per-channel overrides**: Customize the AI's model, personality, and creativity (`temperature`) for each specific channel.
- **Natural Conversation Mode**: Toggle a mode that allows the bot to reply to messages without needing a direct @mention.
- **Usage Tracking Status**: The bot's custom status automatically updates to show the total tokens used in the last 7 days, tracked locally and reliably.
- **Built-in Help & Configuration Display**: Easy-to-use commands (`!help`, `!showconfig`) to view settings and available commands.
- **Permission System**: Clear distinction between server owner, admin, and regular user permissions.
- **Extensible Cog Architecture**: The bot is built using `discord.py` cogs, making it easy to add new commands and features.

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get your own instance of Iris running.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or newer
- A Discord Bot Token
- An OpenRouter API Key

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine or server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drakunovu/aibot.git
cd aibot
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create the Environment File

Create a file named `.env` in the main project directory. This file will store your secret keys. Add the following lines to it, replacing the placeholder text with your actual keys:

```env
# Your Discord bot's token
DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"

# Your API key from OpenRouter.ai
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..."
```

### 5. Run the Bot

Once the setup is complete, you can start the bot with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot should come online in your Discord server, a `bot_usage.db` file will be created to store token logs and a `config.json` file will be also created to store configurations from each server and their channels.
